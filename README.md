The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing and working with __zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)__. This repository contains an efficient implementation of the zkSNARK of [[Groth16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260).

This library is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` toolchain of the Rust compiler. To install the latest version of Rust, first install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via your platform's package manager. Once `rustup` is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:
```bash
rustup install stable
```

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkworks-rs/groth16.git
cargo build --release
```

This library comes with unit tests for each of the provided crates. Run the tests with:
```bash
cargo test
```
